This is a test document to verify the progress calculation fix. We need enough content to create multiple chunks so we can observe the progress updates. The progress should now increase monotonically without any backward jumps. Each batch should show consistent progress increments. This text is designed to be long enough to trigger multiple batches in the translation process. We want to ensure that the progress bar moves smoothly from 0% to 100% without any regression. The fix should eliminate the issue where progress would jump from 15% back to 11% or similar backward movements. This comprehensive test will validate that our progress calculation improvements are working correctly for both text and document translation services.
