# Homepage Language Links Fix Summary

## 🎯 Problem Identified
The "Supported Languages" section on the homepage was incorrectly linking many languages to `/text-translation` instead of their specific `xxx-to-english` pages.

## 🔧 Root Cause Analysis
1. **Missing Language Configurations**: Several synchronized languages were missing from `page-utils.ts`
2. **Incomplete Page Registry**: `EXISTING_TRANSLATION_PAGES` array was outdated
3. **Language Availability**: Some languages were marked as `available: false` in APP_CONFIG
4. **Missing Language Mappings**: Language code to slug mappings were incomplete

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Updated `page-utils.ts`
- ✅ Added all missing language code mappings:
  ```typescript
  'ar': 'arabic',
  'zh': 'chinese', 
  'fr': 'french',
  'hi': 'hindi',
  'pt': 'portuguese',
  'es': 'spanish'
  ```

- ✅ Updated `EXISTING_TRANSLATION_PAGES` to include all 22 synchronized pages:
  ```typescript
  // xxx-to-english pages (11)
  'arabic-to-english', 'burmese-to-english', 'chinese-to-english',
  'creole-to-english', 'french-to-english', 'hindi-to-english',
  'lao-to-english', 'portuguese-to-english', 'spanish-to-english',
  'swahili-to-english', 'telugu-to-english'
  
  // english-to-xxx pages (11)  
  'english-to-arabic', 'english-to-burmese', 'english-to-chinese',
  'english-to-creole', 'english-to-french', 'english-to-hindi',
  'english-to-lao', 'english-to-portuguese', 'english-to-spanish',
  'english-to-swahili', 'english-to-telugu'
  ```

### 2. Updated `APP_CONFIG`
- ✅ Marked Burmese and Telugu as `available: true`
- ✅ Added missing languages (French, Spanish, Portuguese) with proper configurations
- ✅ Added region information for new languages

### 3. Verified All Translation Pages
- ✅ All 22 translation pages exist with correct file structure
- ✅ All pages use `EnhancedTextTranslator` component
- ✅ All pages have proper language configurations
- ✅ All pages follow the same modern UI template
