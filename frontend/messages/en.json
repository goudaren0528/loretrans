      "description": "Everything you need to know about our text translation service",
      "q1_title": "How much does text translation cost?",
      "q1_answer": "Text translation is completely free for up to 500 characters per request. For longer texts (over 500 characters), we charge 0.1 credits per character. For example, a 1000-character text would cost 50 credits (500 free + 500×0.1 = 50 credits).",
      "q2_title": "Which languages do you support?",
      "q2_answer": "We specialize in low-resource languages that are often poorly supported by mainstream translation services. We currently support Haitian Creole, Lao, Swahili, Burmese, Telugu, Chinese, and more. All languages support bidirectional translation with English.",
      "q3_title": "How accurate are the translations?",
      "q3_answer": "Our translations are powered by Meta's NLLB (No Language Left Behind) model, which is specifically designed for low-resource languages. While no automated translation is perfect, NLLB provides significantly better accuracy for small languages compared to traditional translation services.",
      "q4_title": "Do I need to create an account?",
      "q4_answer": "No account is required for free translations (up to 500 characters). However, creating a free account gives you 500 bonus credits and allows you to purchase additional credits for longer translations. You'll also get access to translation history and other premium features.",
      "q5_title": "Can I translate from English to other languages?",
      "q5_answer": "Yes! All our supported languages work bidirectionally. You can translate from English to any supported language, or from any supported language to English. Just use the language selector to choose your desired translation direction.",
      "q6_title": "What's the character limit?",
      "q6_answer": "Free users can translate up to 500 characters per request without any cost. For longer texts, you can either break them into smaller chunks or purchase credits. Registered users get 500 bonus credits to start with, which allows for longer translations.",
