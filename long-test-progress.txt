This is a comprehensive test document designed to verify the progress calculation fix for multi-batch translation processing. We need substantial content to create multiple chunks and batches so we can observe the progress updates in detail. The progress should now increase monotonically without any backward jumps or regression. Each batch should show consistent progress increments that move forward only. This text is specifically designed to be long enough to trigger multiple batches in the translation process, allowing us to validate the fix thoroughly. We want to ensure that the progress bar moves smoothly from 0% to 100% without any regression or backward movements. The fix should completely eliminate the issue where progress would jump from higher percentages back to lower ones, such as from 15% back to 11% or similar backward movements. This comprehensive test will validate that our progress calculation improvements are working correctly for both text and document translation services. The system should now handle progress updates in a way that provides a smooth user experience without confusing backward progress indicators. Each chunk should contribute to forward progress only, and the overall translation progress should be predictable and user-friendly. This extended content ensures we have enough text to create multiple translation chunks that will be processed in separate batches, giving us the opportunity to observe the corrected progress calculation behavior in action.
